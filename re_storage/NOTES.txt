Keep In Mind:
* Want to keep storage network separate from the auto-crafting stuff, so that it can be used independently.

General Tasks:
* Add some dynamic port assignment maybe (start with default port, and switch everybody to new port when they first chat).
* Would be neat to have some security. When system first set up we could keep track of all addresses in a file and validate packets with these.

Storage Tasks:
DONE    * Storage auto imports with redstone comparator and redstone I/O.
* Item formatted name should really use 'n' at end of name to indicate it has NBT and kept separate from other items.
* Item list sent to interface should use a simpler format, don't need to know insert/extract points in interface.
* Storage needs to send item diffs when contents change.
    * Maybe interface will need to do a "fake" pending update of contents and confirm when it gets the message (this could be bad idea)?

Crafting Tasks:
* Network module needs compressed version and testing with drones.
* Seems like we will need to keep a secondary storage table that represents the "available" items, this is reported to interfaces and stuff.
    * This could solve the issue of hiding away intermediate ingredients in crafting process.

Interface Tasks:
* Better item display interface with easy selection.
    * Should feature sorting.
    * Scrolling if possible, else use a key combo with arrow keys instead.
    * Select with arrow keys and enter.
        * Maybe enter + number input for amount, shift-enter for 1, ctrl-enter for stack, ctrl-shift for all?
    * If we have time, consider a color display for this as an option.
        * Click and scroll to get what you want, nice.

Bugs:
* Too many, thanks lua.


New System Layout:
* Storage server controls transposer network.
* Crafting server controls auto-crafting jobs and drone flight plans.
* Interface server presents the user interface.
