# This file was generated by "setup.lua".
# File contains the routing information for the storage network. This includes
# priorities of storage inventories. To change the priorites, look for the
# section labeled "storage:" and rearrange the lines to put higher-priority
# inventories at the top of the section (in the OpenOS editor, use Ctrl+K to cut
# and Ctrl+U to paste).

# Each entry for an inventory has a name (just to help identify it, it can be
# changed to whatever), and a list of connections. Each connection represents a
# transposer index from the "transposers:" section, and a side number (shown
# below for reference). The side refers to the side the transposer touches the
# inventory, not the side of the inventory itself. A transposer can be
# identified in the world by using the Analyzer on it and matching the UUID to
# the one in the transposers section.

# Side numbering: 0 = -y, 1 = +y, 2 = -z, 3 = +z, 4 = -x, 5 = +x
